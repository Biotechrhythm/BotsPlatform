- Develop tasks admin utils
- Make creation of user folder (inject as python command)
- Maybe make not such stupid examples
- Make loggers asynchronous

- Create tests. Test at least chat and basic views
- Make admin utils:
1. List bots in the project
2. Stop bot by his name
3. Start bot by his name
