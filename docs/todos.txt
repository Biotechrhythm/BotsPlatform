ERRORS
======
- Add logs everywhere in views
- Message from admin sending functions doesn't log if raised.

NEW FEATURES
============
- Make REST api view.
- Tasks launch in vulnerable environment. Need to launch that in not raisable function. (like in module runners.py)

REFACTORING
===========
- Write docs
- Make license like GPL
- Try pyright instead of mypy
- Set __all__ in some modules

TODOS TESTS
===========
- Check in tests DatabaseConnectionProvider (sqlite inmemory).
- Check AbstractMessangerView
