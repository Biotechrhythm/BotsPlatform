TODOS
=====
- Finish adequate readme.
- Add logging everywhere in views
- Develop tasks/scheduler
- Problem with context. Make normal polymorphism.
- Make creation of user folder (inject as python command).
- Make REST api view.
- Use standard python Logging (helps to colorize).
- Stop using protected attributes outside classes OR mark as pylint exception.
- Message from admin sending functions doesn't log if raised.
- Make license. Scheduler has GPL.
